= JHipster Side-by-side Blueprint for Multiple Human-Readable Foreign Key Attributes in Angular Client's User Interface

In this article, the word attribute is equivalent to the word field as they relate to entities. Both the words field and attribute will be used interchangeably. 

This is a side-by-side JHipster 7 blue print showing how to put human-readable foreign key field in place of UUIDs into the user interface where entities have relationships with other entities. Sometimes having a UUID makes it difficult for the human in the loop to figure out what the entity on the other side actually is (without clicking on the UUID link). This solution makes it easier for the user to see what the other related entity actually is. Futhermore, this solution is based on adding @customAnnotation's to entity field(s), in the JDL file, that would be shown in replacement of UUIDs. If multiple entity fields are necessary to replace the UUID, the fields can be delimmited via a specified delimiter using a @customAnnotation, as well. 

There is a solution in the JDL syntax to display a field is documented here: https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/relationships.  The JDL syntax to display a field is:
[source]
----
relationship (OneToMany | ManyToOne | OneToOne | ManyToMany) {
  <from entity>[{<relationship name>[(<display field>)]}] to <to entity>[{<relationship name>[(<display field>)]}]+
}
----

An example of the above built-in syntax is (from Matt Raible's "Micro Frontends for Java Microservices" article / github.com code is below):
[source]
----
entity Blog {
  name String required minlength(3)
  handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required
  content TextBlob required
  date Instant required
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}
----

In the above example, the blog's UUID will be replaced by the blog's name in the user interface wher the post will be displayed.

However, the built-in JDL syntax does not provide the ability to display multiple fields to futher distinguish a complex entity.  For example, if multiple blogs can have the same name, we would not be able to tell which blog is in the relationship with the post.  If we could dispaly the blog's name and handle (assuming no 2 blogs can have the same handle), then we would be able to tell which blog is related to the post.  Consequently, this blueprint serves the purpose of relpacing UUIDs with multiple attributes/fields of the other-side relationship with a given entity to help differentiate the entity's relationship on the user interface. 

This example also show how to create a JHipster 7 blueprint.

== Setup for Generating JHipster Blueprints

. Install JHipster 7.9.3:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.9.3
----

. There is a bug, at least on macOS Ventura 13.1, that requires a slight change to the yeoman-environment's package.json file.  You will see an error when running the command:
+
[source,shell]
----
jhipster --version
----

. If you see the following error, there is an easy fix below:
+
[source,shell]

. Add the line "./lib/util/namespace": "./lib/util/namespace.js" to the global yoeman-environment's package.json at the end of the "exports" section as follows.  You will need to add a "," after "./package.json".
+
[source,shell]
